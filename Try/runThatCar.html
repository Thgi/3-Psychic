* *None*

### Instructions

* Using the code from the previous activity as a starting point, create a complete application that meets the following specifications:

  * Users can enter keyboard input (letters).

  * Each of the car's methods are assigned to a key.

  * When the user presses a key, it calls the appropriate function.

  * These letters also trigger a global function called `reWriteStats()` that logs the car's make, model, color, mileage, and `isWorking` status to the console.

* **HINT:*** You WILL need to use the `document.onkeyup()` function to collect input from the user's keyboard.
